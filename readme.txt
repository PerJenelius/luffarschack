How to play
===========
X starts the first round. Each following round is started by the loser of the previous round.
X and O take turns in clicking any empty cell on the.
The objective is to create a row of five symbols vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
The filled cells from finished games stay on the board and those cells are unusable during the following rounds.
The current balance of wins and losses is shown below the board.
The board extends by one row or column when a cell next to the outer edge is clicked. It can probably expand until your computer runs out of memory.
Remember to have fun.
